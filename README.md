Most of the magic happens [here](https://github.com/gazedash/insta-stories-circle/blob/master/src/components/Story.js)

Check out v1, v2.1 and v3 commits

v1 is a simple `<img src="..." />` w/ gradient border, but without white sub-border (1 node)

v2.1 is a div, :after & backgroundImage (2 nodes)

v3 is an img in 2 nested divs (3 nodes)

Instagram itself draws gradient border in canvas.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
